# Color TSR

## What is it

This is a little [TSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminate-and-stay-resident_program)-program that does some syntax-highlighting under MS-DOS

## What it can do

It can change colors of characters inside text-editors like [EDIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor), [Power BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBASIC), [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal), [Turbo C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C), and similar.

## What it can't do

Detecting whether it's running inside such an editor. So it's always coloring.
